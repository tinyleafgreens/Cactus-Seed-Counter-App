# Cactus Seed Counter App! Live on Google Play

The cactus seed counter app leverages the OpenCV package and a specially-developed algorithm to count the number of cactus seeds present in a photograph. The algorithm identifies the seed contours from the photo, counts and draws them on top of the original photo so that the user can visually see that the count is correct. The app is created for Android mobile devices using the Kivy package. It was compiled using Buildozer and uploaded to Google Play for free public use. It was been developed for fun and to ease the lives of cactus enthusiasts everywhere by Tinyleaf Greens.
